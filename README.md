## Technical Requirements 

Here are the technical requirements to get started with this book:

- [Git Installation](#git-installation)
- [Generating Your SSH Public Key](#generating-your-ssh-public-key)

### Git Installation

Follow the instructions on [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to install Git on your system.

### Generating Your SSH Public Key

In this book, you'll need to run the `ssh-keygen` command. While it's included by default on Linux and macOS, Windows users need to install it consciously. If you haven't enabled it yet, refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui).

For detailed SSH setup instructions, you can refer to:
- [Git Documentation: Generating Your SSH Public Key](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key)
- [GitHub Docs: Generating and Adding SSH Key to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

## Recommendations for Windows Users

Windows users may encounter differences in commands compared to Linux users, especially when using the command prompt. To ease the transition and enhance compatibility, consider the following best practices:

### Command Differences

Here are some common differences between Windows Command Prompt and Linux shell:

- `ls` **command**: Windows Command Prompt uses `dir` instead of `ls` to list directory contents.
- `echo` **command**:  While the `echo` command works similarly in both environments, Windows users can also use `echo.` to echo a blank line.
- **File paths**: Windows uses backslashes (`\`) in file paths, while Linux uses forward slashes (`/`).

Also, PowerShell is a powerful alternative to the Command Prompt, offering a more robust and versatile command-line environment.
It also supports some Linux commands. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) for more information.

### Using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

For a more seamless experience with Linux commands and utilities on Windows, consider installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). WSL allows you to run a Linux distribution directly within Windows, providing access to a full-fledged Linux environment.

You can install WSL by following the instructions provided in the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

### Utilizing PowerShell

Alternatively, Windows users can leverage PowerShell, a powerful command-line shell and scripting language built on the .NET Framework. PowerShell offers extensive support for managing both Windows and Linux systems, making it a versatile tool for DevOps tasks.

## Installation of Linux on Windows

To install Linux on Windows using WSL, follow the instructions provided in the [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
